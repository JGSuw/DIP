The Cortex-R DSP Software Library is a suite of common signal processing functions targeted to Cortex-R4/Cortex-R5 based processors. The code has been specifically optimized towards using the extended DSP instruction set of the Cortex-R4/Cortex-R5 processors.

The Cortex-R DSP Library is released under the terms of the end user license agreement ( "CORTEX-R DSP LIBRARY END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT.pdf" ) located in the base directory of this package. Any user of the software package is bound to the terms and conditions of the end user license agreement.

Under the top level of this released package, you will find the following sub-directories:

Docs		- Contains benchmarking information for DSP functions on Cortex-R4 and DSP Functions documentation
Examples	- Contains Example projects created for Corte-R4 processor.
include		- Contains the public header file for the Cortex-R DSP Library and common header files.
Lib		- Contains prebuild libraries of DSP functions for the Cortex-R family processors. It also contains the project files for different Tool chains like MDK, RVDS, CCS,DS-5 and GNU to build the DSP library.
Source		- Contains the source code for the DSP functions.
